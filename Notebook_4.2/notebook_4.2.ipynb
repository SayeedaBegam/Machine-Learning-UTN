However, the implementation itself is done in additional files which are imported in the notebook. Please do not provide any implementation that you want to be considered for correction in this notebook, but only in Python files in the marked positions. A content of a Python file could for example look similar as shown below:\n",

    "For the purpose of this exercise, we did this first step for you!\n",
    "Visit the dataset's [github repository](https://github.com/rr-learning/transferable_dynamics_dataset/tree/master).\n",

    "This dataset was first published at the [2020 International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA)](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/conhome/9187508/proceeding), a conference you will often encounter during your studies, and, if you follow an academic path in the field of robotics, probably visit one day.\n",
    "\n",
    "We provide our own link to the data; make sure you are connected to the internet (or the server on which this notebook's kernel is running on) and run the next cell to download the dataset."
